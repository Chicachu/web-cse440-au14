###Grading

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- Group Project (__65%__)
  - Assignment 1, Project Proposal (__3%__)
  - Assignment 2, Getting the Right Design (__21%__)
    - Milestones (__6%__)
    - Final Report (__15%__)
  - Assignment 3, Getting the Design Right (__14%__)
    - Milestones (__4%__)
    - Final Report (__10%__)
  - Assignment 4, Communicating the Design (__15%__)
    - Project Website (__5%__)
    - Video Prototype (__5%__)
    - Poster (__5%__)
  - Presentations (__12%__)
    - Getting the Right Design Presentation (__5%__)
    - Getting the Design Right Presentation (__5%__)
    - Individual Presentation Score (__2%__)
- Exam (__25%__)
- Individual Readings (__5%__)
- Participation (__5%__)

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded. 
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
Wow us with your work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

### Submission

Many assignments are due "the night before class". Catalyst implements this as 4:00am.

In order to be prepared to give you feedback, the course staff must have your submission in the morning.
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit.

Submissions should be in PDF format (i.e., not plain text, not Word). 
The PDF should be 'printable', containing everything we need to review and grade the assignment (e.g., your name).
The course staff has a large number of submissions to manage, so format and completeness issues are problematic.

###Course Project
This course centers around a term-long group project, in which you will go through the design process with a real idea. In this project, you will:

- Come up with an idea serving a group of people's technological needs
- Learn to design different styles and make tradeoffs among them
- Find real users, investigate their context of use, and test your interface designs within them.

This quarter's projects are themed on __Personal Informatics__, defined as follows:

> Personal informatics systems are systems that _help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of 
> self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge._
>
> [Li _et al._, 2010](http://www.personalinformatics.org/lab/model/).

People are collecting more data about themselves through smartphone and desktop apps, automatically and manually. Your project should address a problem within current personal informatics tools to aid in data collection, self-reflection, or sensemaking.

We hope this course will allow you to create an open-ended design. Your project should __not__ re-create a solution that currently exists, and you should feel free to think beyond the current interaction techniques of mobile and desktop applications. This course is not about creating functional prototypes, but instead about design.

Here are a few examples of course projects from previous offerings. Reports may not map directly to the current offering, as the course structure has changed over the past few quarters. However, these projects represent examples of strong work in this course.
