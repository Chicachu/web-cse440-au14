This display dominates the page, so I tried to add some spacing above. Maybe resizing the images instead would work?

###Course Project
This course centers around a term-long group project, in which you will go through the design process with a real idea. In this project, you will:

- Come up with an idea serving a group of people's technological needs
- Learn to design different styles and make tradeoffs among them
- Find real users, investigate their context of use, and test your interface designs within them.

This quarter's projects are themed on __Personal Informatics__, defined as follows:

> Personal informatics systems are systems that _help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of 
> self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge._
>
> [Li _et al._, 2010](http://www.personalinformatics.org/lab/model/).

People are collecting more data about themselves through smartphone and desktop apps, automatically and manually. Your project should address a problem within current personal informatics tools to aid in data collection, self-reflection, or sensemaking.

We hope this course will allow you to create an open-ended design. Your project should __not__ re-create a solution that currently exists, and you should feel free to think beyond the current interaction techniques of mobile and desktop applications. This course is not about creating functional prototypes, but instead about design.
