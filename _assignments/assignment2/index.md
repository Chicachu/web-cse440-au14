title: "Assignment 2: Getting the Right Design"
---

# Overview

Even for a well-understood, well-motivated problem, choosing a design to invest time into is a difficult and laborious process. This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design through __contextual inquiry__, __task development__, and finally __selecting a design__ from multiple options.

# Milestones
This is a __group__ assignment, consisting of eight milestones.

# Requirements
In this assignment, you will use ideation ([assignment 2a](#project_ideation)) to brainstorm a large set of possible tasks and design ideas for your project. You will then use contextual inquiry (assignments [2b](#contextual_inquiry_plan), [2c](#contextual_inquiry_checkin), and [2d](#contextual_inquiry_review)) to learn more about the practices of your target users/customers. You will draw upon the ideas you developed in [assignment 2a](#project_ideation) and the observations you made in assignments [2b](#contextual_inquiry_plan), [2c](#contextual_inquiry_checkin), and [2d](#contextual_inquiry_review) will help you to develop a set of potential tasks ([assignment 2e](#task_review)) you would like your design to support. Finally, you will sketch initial designs (assignments [2f](#design_checkin) and [2g](#design_review)) supporting your proposed tasks and summarize it in a final report ([assignment 2h](#final_report)).

More specifically, you will do the following:

1. Generate ideas of potential problems, tasks, features, and interactions in the space of your project through a group ideation exercise.

2. Interview and observe at least __three__ target clients using the contextual inquiry method.

3. Informed by the results of your contextual inquiry and the ideas from your ideation, develop __six tasks__ that participants will perform with your application. Select these to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of the design you will create. Create these based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks. Remember that tasks say __what__ is accomplished, while leaving open __how__ to accomplish it. (___Note__: As you progress through the remainder of your project, you __can__ and __should__ consider revising your tasks. Feel comfortable refining or changing your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures. So, the tasks you report in this assignment are not necessarily final._)

4. Brainstorm and sketch __three__ very different initial designs for your interface. Do not illustrate the entire interface, but instead sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality. These should be rough sketches _on paper_ (not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing relationships between screens). Each design should support __four__ tasks. Each design does __not__ need to support the same four tasks as the other designs. __The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space__ _before_ you lock yourself into a single design, so we will be looking for variety in designs and tasks.

5. From your sketches, select __one__ design to pursue for the remainder of the quarter and __two__ interesting tasks that stress its functionality. These tasks should be non-trivial yet crucial to solving your team’s problem. These tasks should emphasize long-lived or repeated activities; a one-time login screen for a social networking application is not worth optimizing, does not stress functionality, and is not interesting.

# Deliverables

<a name="project_ideation"></a>

## 2a: Project Ideation
Due: Completed in section on Friday, October 3, 2014

In your group, you will generate 100 different ideas related to your project proposal. These ideas may include tasks, features (“it would be awesome if …”), problems, and interactions (“how a feature works”). Divide a large sheet of paper (provided) into 100 squares, approximately 2in by 2in. Sketch 100 ideas (e.g. a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea), one in each square. Someone not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.

A few important guidelines:

* Focus on __quantity not quality__ (yes, this is the correct direction)
* No two ideas should be alike
* Include ideas from existing products
* When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas

### Submission
One of the teaching assistants in your section section will sign off on what you completed within the section block.

### Grading
Completion on a good-faith attempt to generate ideas during the ideation brainstorming exercise (3 points)

<a name="contextual_inquiry_plan"></a>

## 2b: Contextual Inquiry Plan
Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 7, 2014

In one paragraph, describe your target user group and other stakeholders for your design. Describe your particular contextual inquiry participants: give some details of their background, the environment where you will observe their practice. Give enough details to convince us that you can actually find and interview your target users in the next week. That is, your target users should not be “doctors”, but a specific group of doctors (e.g. the infirmary ward of the UW teaching hospital). If gaining access to the target users is non-trivial, please describe the steps you have taken to gain access. Also indicate when you will be conducting your three interviews, being as specific as possible.

In another paragraph, describe how you will interact with these target users, and your role as the “apprentice”. Will you be observing their current behaviors? Will you be asking them questions about their desired technological needs? Please be as specific as possible, providing potential interview questions or things you will be observing for.

###Submission

Two paragraphs of text. Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst` 

Be prepared to discuss the plan with other teams and the course staff during lecture.

### Grading
Completion on a 3-point scale based on specificity and feasibility of the plan (3 points)

<a name="contextual_inquiry_checkin"></a>

## 2c: Contextual Inquiry Checkin
Due: Uploaded the night before section Friday, October 10, 2014

You must complete at least one of your contextual inquiry interviews prior to this checkin. You hopefully learned something from this interview about how to conduct a contextual inquiry interview and about the needs of your user group.

Describe your first interview(s)--who you interviewed, their background, and the environment where you observed them. What did you learn from your interview(s)? What tasks or problems did you notice from your interviewee(s)? Did you encounter any problems establishing rapport or squeezing information out of people?

What remains unaddressed from your first interview(s)? We fully expect that changes will be necessary--interviews are difficult to get right, and often times important topics are left unresolved. How do you plan on changing your interview protocol and observation setup in light of your first interview(s)?

###Submission

No more than one page of text. Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

At section, one member of your group is going to be asked to give a short (&le;1 minute) summary of your contextual inquiry thus far.

### Grading
A total of 6 points, split between the information gained from your first interview(s) (3 points) and your plan for your upcoming interviews (3 points).

## 2d: Contextual Inquiry Review
Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 14, 2014

<a name="contextual_inquiry_review_themes"></a>

#### 2d.1 Themes
By this point, you must have completed all three of your contextual inquiry interviews. We would like to hear about what you learned from these interviews. Briefly describe the three people you interviewed, their backgrounds, and their environments. Note anything unique about each interview and comment on the rationale behind these events.

Between the three interviews, we expect common problems facing the user group to begin to emerge. Identify high level themes the participants shared in common in their practices. Do any common tasks to design for emerge from these themes?

<a name="contextual_inquiry_review_task_analysis_questions"></a>

#### 2d.2 Task Analysis Questions
In your submission, include brief answers to the following questions. These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.

1. Who is going to use the system? 
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What’s the relationship between customer & data?
7. What other tools does the customer have?
8. How do customers communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?

### Submission
No more than three pages of text: contextual inquiry themes (&le;1 page) and task analysis questions (&le;2 pages). Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

Be prepared to discuss your Contextual Inquiry findings with other teams and the course staff during lecture.

### Grading
A total of 6 points, split between the description of the user group and quality of the themes developed (3 points) and answers to the task analysis questions (3 points).

<a name="task_review"></a>

## 2e: Task Review
Due: Uploaded the night before class Friday, October 17, 2014

Taking what you learned in your contextual inquiry, you will now design six tasks that you believe are integral to your overarching design. You should include existing and new tasks (i.e., tasks users already do and tasks that will be enabled by your design). These should be real world tasks that have details (e.g. programming a DVR to record the Simpsons on Sundays). These tasks should not have any specific relation to the exact interface sketches that you brainstorm next. Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and task difficulty, from easy to hard tasks.

Each task should be described in text. Be sure that your task conveys a problem rather than a step-by-step walkthrough of a particular design.

### Submission
6 task descriptions (one paragraph each). Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

At section, one member of your group is going to be asked to give a short (&le;1 minute) summary of your tasks thus far.

### Grading
1 point for each task described (6 points total).

<a name="design_checkin"></a>

## 2f: Design Checkin ("3x4")

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 21, 2014

By this point, you have identified and described six important tasks to your design problem. For this checkin, you will now brainstorm and sketch three very different initial designs for your interface. These illustrations do not need to detail the entire interface, but should instead emphasize key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality. These should be rough sketches on paper (not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing relationships between screens). Each design should support four tasks. Each design does not need to support the same four tasks as the other designs. The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design, so we will be looking for variety in designs and tasks.

### Submission
A single document including scanned images of your three initial designs (again, these designs should not be digital mockups). For each design, provide a bulleted list (one sentence for each of the four tasks) detailing how a user might complete that task. Additionally, provide an updated list of tasks for reference within this document.

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading
2 points for each design (6 points total). We grade the designs on the quality and diversity of these ideas, as well as the execution (sketches are rough, transitions are clear, there is enough to get each idea across).

<a name="design_review"></a>

## 2g: Design Review ("1x2")
Due: Uploaded the night before section Friday, October 24, 2014

From your design sketches, select one design and two tasks your users will perform with that design. The two tasks selected need to be representative of the experience using your design. Create a storyboard of each task in your selected design. These should be rough, done on paper and then scanned (do not create or recreate them in a drawing package). The storyboards should convey the major aspects of the design in enough detail that someone outside of your group can understand how the interface supports each task. This section should clearly indicate the functionality of your artifact and what the interface will be like (described and sketched, explicitly referencing the figures in your text). Add more sketches or annotate them in multiple colors if that helps.

Include in your writeup a single paragraph describing why you selected the design you did. Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from your contextual inquiry. Why this design and these tasks? What makes the design better suited to your target users compared to other possibilities? Why are these tasks more compelling than the others? We want to have a good understanding of which interface you chose and why you chose it.

### Submission
A single document including scanned images of your storyboards and a one-paragraph motivation (half a page) explaining why you chose that design and those tasks.

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading
2 points on the rationale behind choosing the particular design, 2 points on the storyboard for each task (6 points total).

## 2h: Final Report
Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 28, 2014

You will submit a report of no more than 8 pages of text, approximately 4000 words. Images are strongly encouraged, do not count against the page limit, and are thus effectively free (the limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed).

Your report should follow the outline below, and will be graded using the guidelines discussed next. If you have completed all the checkins and milestones above, the report should be straightforward to write: you will already have much of the content completed! The provided page allocations are rough estimates, to help convey how to divide up the space.

Note that while the content of this report is often duplicated from previous checkins and reviews, stapling previous documents together is insufficient for this report. Both the course staff and your peers have provided feedback throughout the design process (both on your specific project and other’s projects), and much of what we will be evaluating this report on is how your design and analysis has improved compared to prior checkins and reviews.

1. __Title (1 line, 1 point)__: Something short and catchy to capture the key idea: we will grade you on the creativity and marketability of the title for your project.
2. __Each team member’s name and role (1 point)__
3. __Problem and solution overview (&le;1 paragraph, 2 points)__:
This overview should be a concise statement of the problem you are tackling and a brief synopsis of your proposed solutions.
4. __User group, stakeholders, and contextual inquiry participants (&le;0.75 pages, 3 points)__:
In [assignment 2c](#contextual_inquiry_checkin), you described the first of the three people you interviewed, their background, and their environment. Provide this same detail for all three people you interviewed.
5. __Contextual inquiry results and themes (&le;1.25 pages, 3 points)__:
See [assignment 2d.1](#contextual_inquiry_review_themes). Include any updated themes that emerged when considering your contextual inquiry.
6. __Answers to task analysis questions (&le;2 pages, 3 points)__:
See [assignment 2d.2](#contextual_inquiry_review_task_analysis_questions). Include updated (where necessary) answers to the 11 task analysis questions.
7. __Proposed design sketches: “3x4” (&le;1.25 pages, 3 points)__:
Include scanned images of your three initial designs for their four tasks as in [assignment 2f](#design_checkin). Unlike for [2f](#design_checkin), include complete descriptions (one paragraph per task) for how each design supports each task.
8. __Written scenarios: two tasks (&le;1 page, 3 points)__:
Turn the task descriptions for the two tasks you chose for your selected design in [assignment 2g](#design_review) into written scenarios by adding the proper references to the use of your selected interface. Scenarios include the steps a person will go through to accomplish the task. Your scenarios do not have to detail every little step, but they should be dependent upon the design you have chosen. You will be graded on how realistic your scenarios are, whether they show a proper balance with respect to referencing interface elements, and how well they are written to communicate how a person will accomplish the task.
9. __Storyboards of the selected design (not included in page count, 3 points)__:
See [assignment 2g](#design_review). Include updated storyboards of the design you have selected.

### Submission
A single document in PDF format.

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading
This report is worth a total of `39.324242434242` points, with the point split described above for each section. Additional points pertaining to the entire report are described below:

### Report Clarity (3 points)
Make sure your writing is easy to read: ensure it is clear and concise, use section headings, make liberal use of whitespace, include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions, refer to the figures in the body of your text, and check for grammar errors.
