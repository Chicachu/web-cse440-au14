# Overview

Assigned readings are worth __5%__ of your overall course grade. 

We expect to assign approximately five readings over the length of the quarter.
Each assigned reading has a corresponding open-ended question that will be submitted and graded.
We have set reading deadlines that give you the flexibility to read before or after the related lectures.
Do whichever is best for your personal learning style.

Responses are expected to be at most a couple paragraphs.
Their role is to get you engaged with and thinking about the material.
They will be graded according to whether they provide evidence you understood and considered the material in responding.

We will make additional resources available for students to read as interested.

# Assigned Readings

### Reading 1: Contextual Inquiry
<a name="contextual_inquiry"></a>

- [Beyer and Holtzblatt (1997). Contextual Design. Chapter 3.]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/ContextualInquiry-BeyerHoltzblatt1997.pdf)
  
  Due: Uploaded by the end of the day Friday, October 3, 2014.

  After reading, consider how you might apply this approach to the project you proposed in Assignment 1b.
  
  - Briefly, what is your proposal (e.g., two sentences).
  - Who and what might you propose to observe in a contextual inquiry (e.g., two sentences).
  - What focus might you bring to your observation, and why? (e.g., two or three sentences).
  - Identify a pitfall that seems likely (e.g., getting caught in abstractions) (e.g., two or three sentences).
  - Describe how you might avoid or attempt to correct for this pitfall in your inquiry (e.g., two or three sentences).

  This reading thus serves as some practice planning a contextual inquiry before moving on to your primary project.

### Reading 2: Critique and Teamwork
<a name="critique"></a>

- [Cheng (2013). How to Survive a Critique: A Guide to Giving and Receiving Feedback](http://www.aiga.org/how-to-survive-a-critique/)
- [Katzenbach and Smith (1993). The Discipline of Teams.]({{site.baseurl}}/readings/DisciplineOfTeams-KatzenbachSmith.htm)
- [Pausch. Tips for Working Successfully in a Group.]({{site.baseurl}}/readings/WorkingInGroups-Pausch.html)

  Due: Uploaded by the end of the day Friday, October 10, 2014.
  
  After reading, please think back to your previous experiences working in groups, particularly an experience that could have been improved.
  
  - Briefly describe the project and the group (e.g., two sentences).
  - What went poorly in this group (e.g., two sentences)?
  - From concepts discussed in these readings, what could have been done differently to improve the group experience (e.g., up to two paragraphs)?
  
  These readings thus reflection on receiving feedback, prior group experiences, and how to maximize your success in this course.

  After viewing, consider what approaches were more or less effective in these examples.
  
  - In one paragraph, describe a technique you saw in these videos that was highly effective. Discuss why it was effective.  
  - In one paragraph, describe a technique you saw that was ineffective. Discuss why it was ineffective.

  These videos thus support your reflection on how to effectively develop and illustrate a design.
