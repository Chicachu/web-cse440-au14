# Project Description

In this assignment, you will take a variety of approaches to communicating your design. You will create a video prototype, website, poster, and elevator pitch to describe your work from the entire quarter.

1. You will create a video prototype that illustrates your
   proposed design. Use the storyboards you created in previous assignment as a
   basis for your video prototype. Be sure you both set up the context and show
   the interaction with your design. Refer to the examples provided in lecture
   and videos from prior classes for more information on how to create a video
   prototype.

   A modern smartphone camera can produce high-enough quality video
   for this assignment. However, if your group does not have access to a camera,
   we can loan you a low cost camera; please email us as soon as possible if
   this is the case.

   Your videos should not be longer than __2 minutes__.

2. You will create a project website that provides an overview of the
   project, presents your video prototype, presents your design prototypes,
   introduces team members (with pictures) and provides a link to your final
   write-ups from [assignment 2](../assignment2/) and [assignment 3](../assignment3) and your poster.

3. You will create a poster that explains your design to a general audience.
   The goal of the poster is to learn how to present your work in a
   visual form to interested parties from industry and across campus and how to
   quickly convey the most important aspects of your work. The poster must be
   32"x40" (portrait, vertical). You should be able to summarize the problem and your design
   in an elevator pitch __no more than one minute__ in length. This pitch should convince the audience that your
   problem was worth investigating and that your design effectively solves the
   problem.

# Deliverables

<a name="website_video_checkin"></a>

## 4a: Website and Video Prototype Check-In

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, November 25, 2014

It is important to summarize your design to convey your ideas to others, which
you will do through a website and a video prototype. __We are going to use your
websites and video to advertise the poster session__. While this is a check-in and
you will receive feedback before your final submission, you should submit
complete, high-quality versions of your website and video at this point.

#### 4a.1 Website

First, follow the [contributing](../../contributing.html) instructions to set up your local machine.
The current websites are linked below, and the source files are in the `_projects` folder of the Git repository.

[Aqueous](../../projects/aqueous/)

[Awearness](../../projects/awearness/)

[Band-It](../../projects/bandit/)

[DisTrack](../../projects/distrack/)

[GroupShop](../../projects/groupshop/)

[IE+](../../projects/ieplus/)

[Katching](../../projects/katching/)

[Koala](../../projects/koala/)

[Running With Friends](../../projects/runningwithfriends/)

[SoundScape](../../projects/soundscape/)

Submit a pull request to change your team homepage to be something other than `Test`.

From there, you can decide to build your website however you want. We recommend Jekyll, as that's what the rest of the website is build upon, but feel free to use another system to generate html submit that.

Your website should provide links to all of your previous reports and your video prototype.
From your website, someone interested should be able to infer the importance of your problem
and how your design solves this problem. Be sure to include your team names and pictures!

#### 4a.2 Video Prototype

Using your storyboards as a guideline, create a video prototype that illustrates your proposed design.
Be sure to both set up the context and demonstrate the interaction of your design as part of this video.
Refer to the videos shown in class and as part of the [video prototyping reading](../readings/#prototypingvideos).

Submit your __2 minute__ video prototype in a portable and playable format. It
should be playable on a Windows 7/8 laptop and Mac OS X laptop without any
special codecs installed (H.264 in an mp4 file is a good candidate). It should
be sufficiently high-resolution for projection, but sufficiently compressed that
it can be played on a typical laptop. It should be __less than 50 MB__. If you
submit early drafts of your video, we will test that they play properly.

### Submission

Submit a pull request in github to upload your website and video. Check the [contributing](../../contributing.html) page for instructions on how to submit a pull request.

You do not need to submit a write-up for this assignment, but be sure to keep
updating your “running write-up” (started in [assignment 3](../assignment3), updated in
[assignment 4](#final_everything)) as details of your project evolve.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__:

1.  __Your initial version of your website__: (3 points)
2.  __Your initial version of your video prototype__: (3 points)

Note that these should be __complete__ and will be evaluated as such. We are simply
giving you the opportunity to iterate and refine them before the final poster
session.

## 4b: Poster Critique and Elevator Pitch

Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday, December 4, 2014

#### 4b.1 Poster

Your poster should include:

* Logo
* Project Title
* Value Proposition
* Basic Problem
* How You Solve It / Purpose of the Project
* Key Features
* Design Iteration

Your poster should include _screenshots_ and a _small amount of text_, not full
sentences. There is a 32"x40" PowerPoint Template available [here](posters/sample-poster.ppt).

Feel free to use the template as is, modify it, or not use it at all. There are
additional examples of prior posters [here](posters/).

Your poster may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format. We have a color plotter that
can print posters this size. Your source file is due as stated above. We will
then coordinate proofreading and printing with you.

#### 4.b2 Elevator Pitch

During the final poster session, you will be giving a one-minute ‘elevator
pitch’ to a small group of judges. This pitch should convey your problem, your
solution, and the work you did this quarter to refine and validate your
solution.

__Be prepared to give this pitch in class December 4__, at which point course staff and
other students will give feedback so you can improve your pitch before the final
poster presentation.

### Submission

Submit your poster via Catalyst here: {% if page.link_project4b != nil %}<{{ page.link_project4b }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

Be prepared to give your elevator pitch in class.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__:

1.  __Initial draft of the poster__: (3 points)
2.  __Participation in-class__: (3 points)

## 4c: Poster / Website / Video / Pitch Critique

Due: Completed in section on Friday, December 5, 2014

This is a flexible critique day. The purpose of this day is to help you
refine whichever of your remaining deliverables you need feedback on. Be
prepared to present your poster, website, or video at the critique. This is the
last opportunity for you to get in-class critical feedback, so use it wisely!

### Submission

Bring one of your artifacts to class (e.g. be prepared to show them on a
laptop).

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __3 points__ for participation in-class.

## 4d: Poster Session, Final Video, and Final Website

Due: Website/video/poster uploaded the night before the final exam block. Attend during the final exam block on Monday, December 8, 2014.

You’re almost done! Attend to the final exam block so you can show off your poster and look
at your classmate's posters. We will __not be conducting any evaluation__ at the poster
session itself. Instead, take the opportunity to look at other student's work, chat with judges,
and reflect on a busy and productive quarter.

### Submission

Submit a pull request for your final website and video before the poster
session.

Submit your poster via Catalyst here: {% if page.link_project4d != nil %}<{{ page.link_project4d }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

### Grading

* The website includes links to your previous reports and your video prototype.

##### Visual Design (5 points)

* The website follows design principles that we have discussed in this course.
* The website looks professional and is something you would consider including in a design portfolio.

<!--
As I said in email, I don't think this fits in with your new model of the poster session.

#### Pitch (50 points)

* Is it appropriately timed and prepared? (less than __one minute__)
* Does it convey the problem and your solution?
* Does it convey the work you’ve done to refine and validate your solution?
-->

<!--
TODO: make this the last required reading, perhaps?

#### Video peer reviews (1 points)

`decide if we're doing video peer reviews`

It is important for video prototypes to be accessible and appeal to a large
audience. To measure how well your prototype succeeds at this, we will have each
of you rate the videos as you watch them (including your own teams’ video).
