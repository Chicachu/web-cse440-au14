`link milestones to anchors near headers`

# Overview

This quarter you have narrowed the problem, selected a good design, and
iterated on that design. In the remainder of the quarter, you will work on how
to present that design to others through four means: a video prototype, a
website, a poster, and an elevator pitch.

# Milestones

This is a group assignment, consisting of four milestones.

* Assignment 4a: Website and video prototype checkin

  Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday Nov 25, 2014

* Assignment 4b: Poster critique and elevator pitch

  Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday Dec 4, 2014

* Assignment 4c: Poster / website / video / pitch critique

  Due: Completed in section on Friday Dec 5, 2014

* Assignment 4d: Poster session, final video, and final website

  Due: Website/video uploaded the night before the final exam block. Attend
  during the final exam block on Monday Dec 8, 2014.

# Requirements

1. Video prototype: You will create a video prototype that illustrates your
   proposed design. Use the storyboards you created in previous assignment as a
   basis for your video prototype. Be sure you both set up the context and show
   the interaction with your design. Refer to the examples provided in lecture
   and videos from prior classes for more information on how to create a video
   prototype. If your group does not have access to a camera, we can loan you a
   low cost camera; please email us as soon as possible if you need a camera.

   Your videos should not be longer than 2 minutes.

2. Website: You will create a project website that provides an overview of the
   project, presents your concept video, presents your design prototypes,
   introduces team members (with pictures) and provides a link to your final
   write-ups from assignments 2 and 3.

3. Poster: The goal of the poster is to learn how to present your work in a
   visual form to interested parties from industry and across campus and how to
   quickly convey the most important aspects of your work. The poster must be
   32"x40" (portrait, vertical). This should not be a difficult project; it
   should require a few hours.

4. Elevator Pitch: You should be able to summarize the problem and your design
   in no more than one minute. This pitch should convince the audience that your
   problem was worth investigating and that your design effectively solves the
   problem.

# Deliverables

## 4a: Website and video prototype checkin

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday Nov 25, 2014

It is important to summarize your design to convey your ideas to others, which
you will do through a website and a video prototype. We are going to use your
websites and video to advertise the poster session. While this is a checkin and
you will receive feedback before your final submission, you should submit
complete, high-quality versions of your website and video at this point.

#### 4a.1 Website

Create your website in git pages. `We have absolutely no idea what this means or
how to do it.`

#### 4a.2 Video prototype

Submit your 2 minute video prototype in a portable and playable format. It
should be playable on a Windows 7/8 laptop and Mac OS X laptop without any
special codecs installed (H.264 in an mp4 file is a good candidate). It should
be sufficiently high-resolution for projection, but sufficiently compressed that
it can be played on a typical laptop. It should be less than 50 MB. If you
submit early drafts of your video, we will test that they play properly.
 
You do not need to submit a write-up for this assignment, but be sure to keep
updating your “running write-up” (started in Assignment 3, updated in Assignment
4) as details of your project evolve.

### Submission

Submit a pull request in github to upload your website and video. `might need instructions for pull requests somewhere`

### Grading

Your initial version of your website (6 points) and video prototype (6 points). Note that these should be complete and will be evaluated as such. We are simply giving you the opportunity to iterate and refine them before the final poster session.

## 4b: Poster critique and elevator pitch

Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday Dec 4, 2014

#### 4b.1 Poster

Your poster should include:

* Logo
* Project Title
* Value Proposition
* Basic Problem
* How You Solve It / Purpose of the Project
* Key Features
* Design Iteration

Your poster should include screenshots and a small amount of text, not full
sentences. There is a 32"x40" PowerPoint Template available here:
http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse440/11sp/readings/SamplePoster.ppt `move to repo and make a link to there`

Feel free to use the design as is, modify it, or not use it at all. There are
additional examples of prior posters here:
http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse440/11sp/readings/previousposters/ `curate, move to repo, make ppts pdfs, and make a link to there`

Your poster may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format. We have a color plotter that
can print posters this size. Your source file is due as stated above. We will
then coordinate proofreading and printing with you.

#### 4.b2 Elevator pitch

During the final poster session, you will be giving a one-minute ‘elevator
pitch’ to a small group of judges. This pitch should convey your problem, your
solution, and the work you did this quarter to refine and validate your
solution.

Be prepared to give this pitch in class Dec 4, at which point course staff and
other students will give feedback so you can improve your pitch before the final
poster presentation.

### Submission

Upload a pdf of your poster to Canvas, and be prepared to give your pitch in
class.

### Grading

Initial draft of the poster (3 points) and participation in-class (3 points).

## 4c: Poster / website / video / pitch critique

Due: Completed in section on Friday Dec 5, 2014

Friday is a flexible critique day. The purpose of this day is to help you
refine whichever of your remaining deliverables you need feedback on. Be
prepared to present your poster, website, or video at the critique. This is the
last opportunity for you to get in-class critical feedback, so use it wisely!

### Submission

Bring one of your artifacts to class (e.g. be prepared to show them on a
laptop).

### Grading

Participation in-class (3 points).

## 4d: Poster session, final video, and final website

Due: Website/video uploaded the night before the final exam block. Attend during the final
exam block on Monday Dec 8, 2014.

You’re almost done! Show up to the final exam block so you can present your
one-minute pitch and your poster.

### Submission

Submit a pull request for your final website and video before the poster
session. A member of the course staff will come around and evaluate your poster
and pitch.

### Grading

#### Aesthetics  (50 Points)

* Does the poster have large images that show the key parts of the design?
* Does it include only key minimal text phrases (not paragraphs or long sentences)?
* Are the fonts large and legible?
* Are the colors a pleasing combination and easy to read?

#### Content  (50 pts)

* Does it include all the points listed above?
* Are the key features of the interface clear and labeled where necessary?
* Is there a good evolution of the interfaces changes shown?

#### Pitch (50 pts)

* Is it appropriately timed and prepared? (less than one minute)
* Does it convey the problem and your solution?
* Does it convey the work you’ve done to refine and validate your solution?

#### Video prototype quality (4 pts)

You will be graded on how well your video illustrates your design. Your video
should give a clear idea of what your design is and how it will be used. It
should properly show the context of interaction (present the backstory). It
should be appropriately edited and paced (neither too slow to keep a viewer’s
interest nor too fast to follow).

#### Video peer reviews (1 pts)

`decide if we're doing video peer reviews`

It is important for video prototypes to be accessible and appeal to a large
audience. To measure how well your prototype succeeds at this, we will have each
of you rate the videos as you watch them (including your own teams’ video).

#### Website (2 pts)

Your website will be graded on its visual design and the completeness of its content
