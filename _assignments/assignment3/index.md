# Overview

You selected a design, way to go! It is now time to work on perfecting that
design to the point that an unfamiliar user could approach it and interact with
it. This __group__ assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, utilizes paper
prototyping, peer inspection, user testing, and refinement to improve your
design and serve as the basis of an interactive prototype.

In this assignment, you will use various techniques to iterate on your design.
You will use __heuristic evaluation (3a)__ and __user testing (3b)__ of paper prototypes
to improve your design, eventually producing a final __digital mockup (3c)__ and
__final report (3d)__. 

# Milestones

`tbd`

# Requirements 

1. Based on the results of your sketching, selection, and refinement processes,
   develop a paper prototype of your proposed design. If necessary or
   appropriate, develop new or revised tasks and new or revised scenarios. The
   tasks and scenarios from your previous assignment are likely sufficient, but
   revise them if the need becomes apparent in your development of this paper
   prototype or if necessary to provide better coverage of your proposed
   functionality. Your low-fidelity prototype should convey all critical aspects
   of your design and support testing the __two (2)__ tasks that you turned into
   scenarios in your previous report.
2. Find at least __three (3)__ participants to work through your tasks using your
   paper prototype. You should not use friends, members of the class, or people
   you know to have engineering backgrounds. Nor should you use people who have
   been previously exposed to your project. Target an appropriate set of people
   based on your design and your contextual inquiry.
    
   Have one of your teammates demonstrate the system to show the participant
   how they would interact with your design. Do not show your participants how
   to perform your tasks. Instead show them how paper prototyping works, how
   your system generally works, and give an example of something specific that
   is sufficiently different from your tasks.
   
   Be sure to divide yourselves into experimental roles when conducting the
   paper prototyping evaluation; there is simply too much for a single team
   member to conduct the entire experiment. As discussed in class, these roles
   include the computer, the facilitator, and the observer.
   
   During the experiment, __make a log of critical incidents__ (both positive and
   negative events). For example, a person might make a mistake or might
   comment on something they like. Write it down along with a description of
   what was going on. Later you should discuss and prioritize these events and
   assign __severity ratings__ to problems (use the ratings from the Heuristic
   Evaluation lecture, ranging from 0 for no problem to 4 for usability
   catastrophe).
   
   Each participant should perform all three tasks. Keep the data separate for
   each task and participant. Keep participant names confidential. Remember
   participation must be voluntary. Consider using an informed consent form,
   such as the example form at: `add consent form to repo and insert link`

3. Refine your design based on the results of your testing. If necessary or
   appropriate, develop new or revised tasks and new or revised scenarios. Your
   tasks and scenarios are likely stable at this point, but be sure to revise
   them if your testing reveals a need.

# Deliverables 

## 3a: Paper prototype checkin and heuristic evaluation 

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday Nov 4, 2014 

#### 3a.1 Paper prototype 

Create a paper prototype based on the design selected in __assignment 2g__. A new
user should be able to use the paper prototype to complete the two
representative tasks selected in __assignment 2g__ with all intermediate screens,
widgets, etc. implemented (as well as potential _incorrect_ paths). Bring your
completed paper prototype to class on Tuesday, November 4th.

#### 3a.2 In-class heuristic evaluations 

Each project group will split in half to conduct heuristic evaluations. Each
half-group will pair off with another half-group from a different project. For
15 minutes, one half-group will conduct a heuristic evaluation of the other
half-group’s paper prototype. After 15 minutes, groups swap evaluator/evaluatee
roles. Each half-group will __receive__ and __conduct__ one heuristic evaluation. Thus,
each project group will receive __two__ evaluations of their design.

When acting as evaluators, you will be given index cards on which to record
your evaluation. Write down any usability issues you encounter, including the
category and severity rating from Neilsen’s heuristic evaluation framework. Also
note how difficult you estimate it would be to fix the problem. At the end of
the evaluation, the evaluated group will keep the index cards so that they can
use them to improve their design.

### Submission

A short (maximum 1 page of text not including images) document. This should
include a description of your paper prototype. What are the main pieces of
functionality? What are the main interaction ideas? How does a person operate
it? Reference images of the interface in your description. Include one picture
of the entire paper-based system with all of its elements laid out.

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

During class, a member of the course staff will come around during class and
sign off that you completed your paper prototype and heuristic evaluation.

### Grading

__9 points total__: the description of your paper prototype of the selected design
__(3 points)__, bringing the physical prototype to class __(3 points)__, and involvement
in the peer inspection activity __(3 points)__.


## 3b: Paper prototype and user testing checkin
Due: Uploaded the night before section and brought to section on Friday Nov 7, 2014

#### 3b.1 Heuristic evaluations and initial user testing results

In __assignment 3a__, you received __two__ heuristic evaluations of your design. By
this point, you should also have run __at least one__ person through user testing
your paper prototype. As a group, discuss what you learned from all of these
evaluations, and make the necessary changes to your paper prototype. Bring your
updated paper prototype to recitation on Friday, November 7th.

#### 3b.2 User testing plan

Describe who will participate in your user tests and how they were selected.
Also describe the testing environment and how the prototype and any other
equipment will be set up. Describe some relevant details of your testing
procedure. This should include the experimental roles of each member of the
team.

#### 3b.3: Paper prototype design critique

During recitation, you will demonstrate your two tasks within your paper
prototype, followed by a group critique of your current design.

### Submission

A short (maximum 3 pages) document describing what you learned from the
heuristic evaluation in __assignment 3a.2__. It should also describe what changes
you have made to your paper prototype. A member of the course staff will come
around during class and sign off on your modified paper prototype and your
participation in the user testing critique.

Please include a one-page description your user testing and what you have
learned from your first participant. Describe the setup of the user test, the
testing environment, and the experimental roles of each member of your team. How
did your first user test go? Do you feel the need to change your protocol at
all?

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading

Completion of what you learned from the heuristic evaluation __(3 points)__, what
you learned from your first user test __(3 points)__, modifications to your paper
prototype __(3 points)__, and participation in the user testing critique __(3 points)__.

## 3c: Digital mockup 

Due: Uploaded the night before section Friday Nov 14, 2014

The goal of this assignment is to build digital mockup of your design. You will
(1) revise your interface design based on the results of testing your paper
prototype and (2) use digital tools to create a higher-fidelity prototype. At
this point, you should have run __three__ people through user testing of your paper
prototype. 3c.1 User testing and design critique results

Summarize the results of __all__ user tests from your process data, supplemented
with results from the design critique in __assignment 3b.3__. What did you learn in
testing? Describe what you looked for or measured during the user testing. You
should concentrate on process data (i.e., what is happening in the big picture)
in addition to bottom-line data (i.e., time or number of errors).

#### 3c.2 Digital mockup

Consider further revisions to your interface based upon results of user testing
your paper prototype and in-class critiques. If necessary or appropriate,
develop new and/or revised scenarios for your tasks. The tasks and scenarios
from your low-fidelity assignment are likely sufficient, but __be sure to revise
them if suggested by your testing__ or if necessary to provide better coverage of
your proposed functionality. __If you are substantively changing your tasks or
your scenarios, make an appointment with us immediately__ to discuss your new
tasks, design ideas, and storyboards.

You __should not__ transition into digital mockups until high-level aspects of your
design and tasks are nailed down. It is much easier to iterate on these aspects
of the design in the paper prototyping phase. As you transition into digital
prototyping, you will begin to focus on other aspects of the design: visual
design, layout, color, typography, etc.

We have no strong preference to what digital tools you utilize to create your
prototype, but it __must__ be digital (e.g. you may not scan a hand-drawn sketch).
Some recommendations from the course staff include Omnigraffle, Adobe
Illustrator, InkScape, and Microsoft Visio.

#### 3c.3 Design critique

During recitation, we will conduct another design critique of your digital
mockup.

### Submission

A short (maximum 2 pages of text not including images) document describing your
three users and what you learned from user testing and the design critique in
__assignment 3b.3__. It should also describe how your mockup changed from your paper
prototype as a result of these evaluations. Your document should also contain
screenshots of your digital mockup (does not count toward the page limit).

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading

Description of your users and of what you learned from your user testing and
the design critique __(6 points)__, quality of your digital mockup, including
implementing changes from your paper prototype __(3 points)__, and participation in
the design critique __(3 points)__.

## 3d: Final report

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday Nov 18, 2014

You will submit a report of _no more than_ __8 pages__ of text, approximately 4000
words. Images are strongly encouraged, __do not count against the page limit__, and
are thus effectively free (the limit applies to the approximate amount of text
you would have if all images were removed).

Your report should follow the outline below, and will be graded using the
guidelines discussed next. __If you have completed all the checkins and milestones
above, the report should be straightforward to write__: you will already have much
of the content completed! The provided page allocations are rough estimates, to
help convey how to divide up the space.

Note that while the content of this report is often duplicated from previous
checkins and reviews, _stapling previous documents together is insufficient for
this report_. Both the course staff and your peers have provided feedback
throughout the design process (both on your specific project and other’s
projects), and much of what we will be evaluating this report on is __how your
design and analysis has improved compared to prior checkins and reviews__.

#### 1. Title (1 line, 1 point)

Something short and catchy to capture the key idea: we will grade you on the
creativity and marketability of the title for your project.

#### 2. Each team member’s name and role (1 point)

#### 3. Problem and solution overview (<=1 paragraph, 2 points)

This overview should be a concise statement of the problem you are tackling and
a brief synopsis of your proposed solutions.

#### 4. First paper prototype (<=1 page, 20 points)

__See 3a.1__. You do not need to update your original prototype in this section.

#### 5. Testing process (<=1 page, 20 points)

__See 3b.2__. Include any changes that were made to the experimental setup,
participants, etc. from what you anticipated.

#### 6. Testing results (<=2 pages, 20 points)

Summarize the results of all user tests from your process data: __3b.1__ (heuristic
evaluations), __3c.1__ (user testing and design critiques) and __3c.3__ (digital mockup
critique).

#### 7. Final paper prototype (<=1 page, 20 points)

Describe the final version of your paper prototype as you did for your first
paper prototype above. This section should include information about what
changed between these versions, and what spurred these changes (e.g. user tests,
heuristic evaluations, or a design critique).

#### 8. Digital mockup (<=1 page, X points)

Update the digital prototype submitted in __assignment 3c.2__, updating it based on
recommendations provided in the design critique conducted in __assignment 3c.3__.
Briefly describe the changes made to your digital mockup as a result of this
design critique. Also include complete descriptions (one paragraph per task) for
your design supports each of your tasks.

#### 9. Discussion (<=1 page, 20 points)

Reflect upon and discuss your project and your results. What did you learn from
the process? How did the process shape your design? Is there something you think
you did _not_ uncover?

#### 10. Appendix (10 points)

The appendix should include copies of all materials involved in the experiment.
This includes your consent form, demo script, and any instructions or task
descriptions you handed out or read aloud to your participants.
 
Finally, it should include _all_ the raw process data you gathered during the
experiment. Clean it up to make it easier to read. Merge the critical incidents
logged by the observers and list them.
 
The appendix materials and screenshots do not count in your page limit.
