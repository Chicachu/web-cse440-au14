title: "Assignment 1: Project Proposal"
---

# Overview
Your assignment is to propose a __problem__ and an __approach__ that could form the basis of a project for this course.
Successful projects will observe the need for good human-centered design in an interactive computing system, 
analyze the challenges of supporting effective interaction, explore potential designs, and propose a compelling solution.

# Milestones
This proposal is an individual assignment, consisting of three milestones.

# Project Description
The theme for projects in this course is __personal informatics__:

> Personal informatics systems are systems that _help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of 
> self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge._
>
> [Li _et al._, 2010](http://www.personalinformatics.org/lab/model/).

Examples include systems like [FitBit](http://www.fitbit.com/) and [RunKeeper](http://www.runkeeper.com/) (for tracking physical activity), [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) (for tracking food intake), [Mint](http://www.mint.com/) (for tracking finances), [Moves](http://www.moves-app.com/) (for tracking location), or [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm) (for 
tracking music listening).

Your proposal must go _beyond_ a technology-centric proposal of a webpage, phone application, or interaction. Think about 
the problems that people face in their day to day lives, how we can approach those problems, and the role for interactive computing.
This first assignment is your opportunity to think broadly about a problem. Subsequent assignments will provide 
opportunities to focus on designing a specific technological solution to a specific set of tasks.

You should identify and consider problems in activities that are important to people. Potential examples include:

* living a healthy life
* helping people remember to track
* managing time or finances effectively
* identifying behavioral patterns
* sharing accomplishments with friends and family
* plans for starting to track

Do not start with a focus on concrete one-time tasks (e.g., logging into your bank account). Instead identify problems in 
long-lived activities that span many different social or technological contexts. For example, if you want to help people 
manage their money, do not immediately propose a website that addresses one specific task. Instead consider the range of
other opportunities (e.g., computers in public spaces, personal mobile devices, point of sale systems).

Focus on creating or improving a specific application or service that addresses the issues of an actual community. 
You must be able to create and evaluate a design within the timeframe of this course, so consider whether you 
can reasonably gain access to the necessary population. We encourage you to think big, expanding upon your application 
to include new ideas for interaction techniques or technology platforms. Do not feel constrained by current devices, 
but instead aim to explore an exciting design that could potentially motivate the development of new enabling technology.

The course instructors will select a subset of submitted proposals for sponsorship. Sponsored proposals will be posted,
and students will then bid on the projects they want to pursue in this course. Your proposal is thus an effort to 
convince both the instructors and your classmates that a problem is interesting, tractable, and worthy of investigation.

# Deliverables

<a name="proposal_brainstorm"></a>

## 1a: Proposal Brainstorm
Due: Uploaded the night before section and brought to section Friday, September 26, 2014

Propose three ideas as starting points for brainstorming. Each idea should be a single sentence. 

Be prepared to talk about your initial ideas with other students.

### Submission
Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

Bring your proposal ideas to section (on your laptop or on paper) so that you can use them as a starting point 
in the brainstorm.

### Grading
`decide on grading -James; I'm fine with this as-is -Matt`
One point for each unique proposed idea (i.e. don't submit small variations on the same idea). (3 pts)

## 1b: Project Proposal
Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, September 30, 2014

You will submit a two-paragraph proposal of at most 500 words of text. Any images are free, but the final document must 
fit on a single page. The points your essay should address are:

1. Problem and Motivation (3 pts)

   Describe the problem. This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, and worth 
   spending a quarter considering. It states what the problem is and why it is a problem or describes a new idea and why it 
   will enhance an existing application or work practice.

2. Analysis of Problem (3 pts)

   The analysis section should give more background for the problem or new idea. It does not just focus on the negative 
   aspects of the current situation, but also identifies some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few 
   salient examples from existing systems or work practices should be used to support those claims.
   
   If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

## Submission
Your submission must be in PDF format. 

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading
`Random grading is random`

Your proposal should consist of the two paragraphs outlined above (6 pts). You will additionally be graded on:

3. Creativity (3 pts)

   The proposal should try to address a practical problem with a novel use of technology or present a new or enhanced practice enabled by technology.

4. Writing (3 pts)

   Make sure your writing is easy to read: ensure it is clear and concise and check for grammar errors.

## 1c: Project Bid
Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday, October 2, 2014

Review the sponsored projects and course instructor comments regarding those projects.

`Are there any more instructions for bidding?`

Then bid on projects and potential partners. Course instructors will use your bids to assign projects and groups. 

### Submission
Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading
Completion. Submitting a project bid is a requirement for proceeding in the class.
